summary: The 8 fallacies of distributed computing
---

*Essentially everyone, when they first build a distributed application, makes the following eight assumptions. All prove to be false in the long run and all cause big trouble and painful learning experiences:*

1. *The network is reliable*
2. *Latency is zero*
3. *Bandwidth is infinite*
4. *The network is secure*
5. *Topology doesn't change*
6. *There is one administrator*
7. *Transport cost is zero*
8. *The network is homogeneous* 

**Peter Deutsch**, 1994
