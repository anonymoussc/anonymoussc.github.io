In essence, a design pattern is about describing a reusable solution to a problem when given a specific context. Design patterns to mitigate challenges with microservices.

1. *Service discovery*
2. *Edge server*
3. *Reactive microservices*
4. *Central configuration*
5. *Centralized log analysis*
6. *Distributed tracing*
7. *Circuit Breaker*
8. *Control loop*
9. *Centralized monitoring and alarms*

This list is not intended to be comprehensive; it's a minimal list of design patterns that are required to handle the challenges in microservice.
