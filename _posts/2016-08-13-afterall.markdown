summary: The story behind of a repository called 'tyasgondola'.
---

I once had an github repository called 'tyasgondola', it has it own story behind. Your, lives are supposed to be like climbing a cliff, sometime You need not to look to the bottom, You need not to look back or you will probably fall. Some people are like to using a gondola lift, in a freezing snowy mountain with a glass of hot choco milk moving forward while watching the world. Some world flourish, and some are perish.

Your world are the reflection of your mind, you change your thought and you change the world. As like anything else, this world has it's own need of drive, or life energy. In relation with themselves, some world are taken that from and destructed the source, some are giving its own, and strengthening itself, some other begging for it. But nevertheless, a good deeds always bring a good karma.

When you have the right mindset, you already 80% success in achieving your goal, the rest of the way was 18% for tactical superiority, 1% timing, 1% luck. Timing in as, when all you have was a chainsaw, knowing when to use it or knowing when not to use it was power. Knowing when you should pull a trigger as [peacetime ceo or wartime ceo](http://www.bhorowitz.com/peacetime_ceo_wartime_ceo).

Luck such in as, when preparation meet opportunity.

Yet the other 900% are unknown.
