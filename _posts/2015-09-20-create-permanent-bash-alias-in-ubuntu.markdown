summary: How to create those ^ in the title.
---

1. Create _.bash_aliases_ file in `~/` (home directory).
2. To see hidden file in `~/` :  
    a. Nautillus file manager can use `ctrl + h` keyboard shorcut.   
    b. Dolphin file manager can use `alt + .`.

Example _.bash_aliases_ : 

{% gist 1c28e79b8baea0f55b54 %}

Instead `sudo apt-get install` user can just type `agi` in the terminal.
