There are many distributions of Linux. Some popular ones are __Arch__, __Debian__, __Ubuntu__, __Redhat__, __CentOS__, __Fedora__ and __CoreOS__. Many of these distributions are related to each other in some way. For example, some of these distributions are _“downstream”_ from others. A downstream __Linux__ distribution includes the upstream’s distribution’s changes, and may add their own.

For example, __Ubuntu__ is based on __Debian__ and is considered downstream of __Debian__. __CentOS__ is based on __RedHat__ and is therefore downstream from __RedHat__. __RedHat__ sponsors __Fedora__ and so __Fedora__ is very similar to __RedHat__ and __CentOS__ (although it has a much more rapid release cycle).

Each distribution has opinions about __Linux__ and its use.
