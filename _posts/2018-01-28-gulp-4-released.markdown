My [first post](https://anonymoussc.github.io/software-engineering/gulp/2015/05/02/installing-gulp-4-alpha/) at may 2, 2015 are about how to install gulp v4-alpha, currently gulp v4.0.0 stable has been released at [Jan 1, 2018](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/releases/tag/v4.0.0).

Some good feature, we are not needed to using run-sequence anymore, running task in series and parallel are baked right in into core functionality and many more.
