Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth. Better than a thousand hollow words, is one word that brings peace.

We are shaped by our thoughts; we become what we think. When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves. You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger.

No one saves us but ourselves. No one can and no one may. We ourselves must walk the path.

I am not the first Buddha who came upon Earth, nor shall I be the last. In due time, another Buddha will arise in the world - a Holy One, a supremely enlightened One, endowed with wisdom in conduct, auspicious, knowing the universe, an incomparable leader of men, a master of angels and mortals.

Of those beings who live in ignorance, shut up and confined, as it were, in an egg, I have first broken the eggshell of ignorance and alone in the universe obtained the most exalted, universal Buddhahood.
