If anybody feel generous after the next time skip, better don't. Should have been pay better attention in the _sworn enemy behavior_ lesson in elementary school.

Other thing, one does not simply walk into mordor, not with 10.000 man I can do it, it's folly. The very air we breathe are toxicating, it's drive you mad. 

There are live and breathe any kind of beast and foul creature. Help and service granted because the gold, when it has run out the anonymous will be the first to betray.

### One treat other like usopp
### The name are different
