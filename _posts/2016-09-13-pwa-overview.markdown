### What is Progressive Web App ?
- Progressive Web App (PWA) is a term used to denote a new software development methodology. Unlike traditional applications, Progressive Web App can be seen as an evolving hybrid of regular web pages (or websites) and a mobile application. This new application life-cycle model combines features offered by most modern browsers with benefits of mobile experience. [Progressive web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app)
- It's primary purpose is for creating progressive web apps: web applications that can be installed to the homescreen of a device without needing the user to go through an app store (along with other superpowers such as being available offline and presenting users with push notifications when application content changes.).

- A progressive web application takes advantage of the latest technologies to combine the best of web and mobile apps. Think of it as a website built using web technologies but that acts and feels like an app. [A Beginner’s Guide To Progressive Web Apps](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/a-beginners-guide-to-progressive-web-apps/)
- It stands for Progressive Web App, and it lets developers build a mobile website that can perform super-fast and behave just like an app. Users can also copy the site’s homepage to their homescreen and open it like an app. [WTF are Progressive Web Apps?](http://digiday.com/platforms/wtf-progressive-web-apps/)
