A __service-oriented architecture (SOA)__ is an architectural pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol, typically over a network. The principles of service-orientation are independent of any vendor, product or technology. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture)

### SOA framework

SOA-based solutions endeavour to enable business objectives while building an enterprise-quality system. SOA architecture is viewed as five horizontal layers:

1. _Consumer Interface Layer_ – These are GUI for end users or apps accessing apps/service interfaces.
2. _Business Process Layer_ – These are choreographed services representing business use-cases in terms of applications.
3. _Services_ – Services are consolidated together for whole-enterprise in-service inventory.
4. _Service Components_ – The components used to build the services, such as functional and technical libraries, technological interfaces etc.
5. _Operational Systems_ – This layer contains the data models, enterprise data repository, technological platforms etc.

There are four cross-cutting vertical layers, each of which are applied to and supported by each of the following horizontal layers:

1. _Integration Layer_ – starts with platform integration (protocols support), data integration, service integration, application integration, leading to enterprise application integration supporting B2B and B2C.
2. _Quality of Service_ – Security, availability, performance etc. constitute the quality of service parameters which are configured based on required SLAs, OLAs.
3. _Informational_ – provide business information.
4. _Governance_ – IT strategy is governed to each horizontal layer to achieve required operating and capability model.
