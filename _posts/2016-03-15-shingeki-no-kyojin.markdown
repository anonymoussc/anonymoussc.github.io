__Shingeki No Kyojin__ a.k.a __Attack On Titan__ is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by __Hajime Isayama__. The series began in Kodansha's Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine on September 9, 2009.

Despite it's successes, Shingeki no kyojin was one of the most darkest and saddest anime / manga _otaku_ people are ever watch. One of the strongest female character was __Mikasa Ackerman__ (ミカサ・アッカーマン Mikasa Akkāman), one of his line in episode 7 after hearing his adoptive brother __Eren Yeager__ (エレン・イェーガ Eren Jäger/Eren Jaeger) died and before charge into a horde of titan surrounding the HQ _"If I can't defeat them then I die, but if I win then I live, the only way to win is to fight"_ was quite memorable.

Rated __9.2/10__.
