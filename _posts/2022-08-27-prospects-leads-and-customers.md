Customer journey, it includes prospects and leads before they become customers. In simple words, this is what characterizes each group:

- Prospects: People who don't know your brand exists yet. They know they want or need a product or service, but they're only starting their journey, searching for the best option.

- Leads: People who have expressed an interest in your product or service but are still thinking about their options. They're at the consideration stage, but they're watchful in terms of content related to your brand and products.

- Customers: People who buy from your company. Clients can be super clients or fans if you treat them properly, with care and attention.
