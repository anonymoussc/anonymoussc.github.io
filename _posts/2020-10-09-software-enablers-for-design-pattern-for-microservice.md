summary: Software enablers for design pattern for microservice
---

a number of very good open-source tools that can help us both meet our expectations of microservices and, most importantly, handle the new challenges that come with them:

1. Spring Boot
2. Spring Cloud/Netflix OSS
3. Docker
4. Kubernetes
5. Istio (a service mesh)

## Table maps software enablers

| Design Pattern | Spring Boot | Spring Cloud | Kubernetes | Istio |
| ---------------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------|
| Service discovery |  | Netflix Eureka and Netflix Ribbon | Kubernetes kubeproxy and service resources |  | 
| Edge server |  | Spring Cloud and Spring Security OAuth | Kubernetes Ingress controller | Istio ingress gateway |
| Reactive microservices | Spring Reactor and Spring WebFlux |  |  |  |
| Central configuration |  | Spring Config Server | Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets |  |
| Centralized log analysis |  |  | Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana |  |
| Distributed tracing |  | Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin |  | Jaeger |
| Circuit Breaker |  | Resilience4j |  | Outlier detection |
| Control loop |  |  | Kubernetes controller manager |  |
| Centralized monitoring and alarms |  |  | Grafana and Prometheus | Kiali, Grafana, and Prometheus |
