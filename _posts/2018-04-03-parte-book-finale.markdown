I have been in this place since November last year, itâ€™s all a good and fine place to work. However, as like with the change of a season, the cycle will begin anew.

I have done thinking through and recalculate any possibilities, a long-long time ago, about the question _"what happen when the unmovable object collide with the unstoppable object"_.

### Book writing

Initially it's supposed to be just one book, end up with breaking it up into three part.

1). __In the beginning: the story behind 25.000.000 line of code - codenamed railgun__

Need to give a finishing touch into two last chapter: _"Heaven gift"_ and _"Final gift of farewell"_

2). __End of an era: The lord that departure to Valhalla - into you 3000 years later__

This mark as completed. Part two play a major role into the creation of part three and the change individual of main character as well as entire story line.

3). __Dawn of new age - Luminescence__

The continuation of part two. This happen in very distant future of diamond age, humanity have established a sea colonies, which enabled humanity to create a city in the sea floor, and space colonies which enabled humanity to create a floating cities in the outer space.
