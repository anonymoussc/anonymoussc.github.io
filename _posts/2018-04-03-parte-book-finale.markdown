I have been in this place since November last year, itâ€™s all a good and fine place to work. However, as like the change of season, the cycle will begin anew.

I have done thinking through and recalculate any possibilities, a long-long time ago, about the question "what happen when the unmovable object collide with the unstoppable object" the answer are obvious: both are destruct. No if, no how, no why, no when. Period. Best thing we can are to unload the stuff that matter, keep stuff that does not really matter, and everything else into a scrap of history and never look back.

### Book writing

Initially it's supposed to be just one book, end up with breaking it up into three part.

1. __In the beginning: the story behind 25.000.000 line of code - codenamed railgun.__

Need to give a finishing touch into two last chapter: _"Heaven gift"_ and _"Final gift of farewell"_

2. __End of an era: The lord that departure to Valhalla - into you 3000 years later__

This mark as completed. Part two play a major role into the creation of part three and the change of main character as well as entire story line.

3. __Dawn of new age - Luminescence__

Many stuff going on, this happen in very distant future of diamond age, humanity have established a sea colonies, which enabled humanity to create a city in the sea floor, and space colonies which enabled humanity to create a floating cities in the outer space. 

After the collapse of majority _corporate republic_ form of government in the world, two major ideologies born and enter into a new cold war. While a small group of earth nature restoration movement, the ecotopian try to force it's way with the act of violent and annihilation. 

In the totally polluted world and dark age where the destruction of entire planet as easy as a push of a button, and the many world leader try to solved their different through _'word'_ like carpet bombing, missile storm, napalm bomb many thing can happen. 

On progress.
