### What is Progressive Web App ?
- Progressive Web App (PWA) is a term used to denote a new software development methodology. Unlike traditional applications, Progressive Web App can be seen as an evolving hybrid of regular web pages (or websites) and a mobile application. This new application life-cycle model combines features offered by most modern browsers with benefits of mobile experience. [Progressive web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app)
- It stands for Progressive Web App, and it lets developers build a mobile website that can perform super-fast and behave just like an app. Users can also copy the siteâ€™s homepage to their homescreen and open it like an app. [WTF are Progressive Web Apps?](http://digiday.com/platforms/wtf-progressive-web-apps/)
